    | CUDA 13.x                  | Turing              | 7.5 (``sm_75``)        | GeForce RTX 20xx series                  |
    +----------------------------+---------------------+------------------------+------------------------------------------+

To determine your GPU's compute capability, see `NVIDIA CUDA GPUs <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus>`__.

* **Driver Requirements**: The driver requirements are determined by the CUDA Toolkit version used to build the Warp
  library, not the version installed on the system when running Warp.

  * Warp packages built with CUDA Toolkit 12.x require NVIDIA driver 525 or newer.
  * Warp packages built with CUDA Toolkit 13.x require NVIDIA driver 580 or newer.
  * PyPI wheels for Windows/Linux are currently built with CUDA 12.8.

* **Advanced Features**: Half-precision (``float16``) atomic operations require compute capability 7.0+ (Volta). 
  On older GPUs, these operations return zero.

* **CPU-only execution** is supported on all platforms for users without a GPU.

Build requirements
------------------

To build Warp from source, you need:

**Compilers:**

* Windows: Microsoft Visual Studio 2019+
* Linux: GCC 9.4+ (C++17 support)
* macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools

**Core Tools:**

* Python 3.8+
* `Git LFS <https://git-lfs.com>`__ (for assets used in tests, examples, and documentation)
* NumPy

**Optional:**

* CUDA Toolkit (required to build Warp with GPU support, not available on macOS):

  * Minimum: CUDA Toolkit 12.0
  * For full libmathdx support: CUDA Toolkit 12.6.3+
  * For conditional graph node support: CUDA Toolkit 12.3+

* libmathdx (auto-fetched via Packman by default)
* LLVM/Clang (auto-fetched via Packman by default)

**Building:**

.. code-block:: console

    $ python build_lib.py
    $ pip install -e .

Run ``python build_lib.py --help`` for build options like ``--cuda_path``, ``--mode``, and ``--verbose``.

For detailed instructions, see :doc:`installation`.

Support policies
================

This section describes how Warp manages change over time, including versioning, API stability, 
deprecation practices, and platform support lifecycle. Understanding these policies helps you plan 
upgrades and anticipate breaking changes.

Versioning
----------

Warp library versions take the format X.Y.Z, similar to `Python itself <https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/development-cycle/#devcycle>`__:

* Increments in X are reserved for major reworks of the Warp library causing disruptive incompatibility (or reaching the 1.0 milestone).
* Increments in Y are for regular releases with a new set of features. May contain deprecations, breaking changes, and
  removals.
* Increments in Z are for bug fixes. In principle, there are no new features. Can be omitted if 0 or not relevant.

This is similar to `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ minor versions if well-documented and gradually introduced.

**Prerelease versions**

In addition to stable releases, Warp uses the following prerelease version formats:

* **Development builds** (``X.Y.Z.dev0``): The version string used in the source code on the main branch between 
  stable releases (e.g., ``1.11.0.dev0``).
* **Release candidates** (``X.Y.ZrcN``): Internal pre-release versions for QA testing before a stable release, 
  starting with ``rc1`` and incrementing (e.g., ``1.10.0rc1``). Not published externally.
* **Nightly builds** (``X.Y.Z.devYYYYMMDD``): Automated builds from the main branch published on the 
  `NVIDIA PyPI index <https://pypi.nvidia.com>`__ with the build date appended (e.g., ``1.11.0.dev20251030``).

Prerelease versions should be considered unstable and are not subject to the same compatibility guarantees as stable releases.

Component states
----------------

All supported components (e.g. API functions, Python versions, GPU architectures) exist in one of the following states:

* **Experimental**: A new feature that is still under active development.
  It is available for early adopters to test and provide feedback, but its design may change with little or no notice.
* **Stable**: The default state for most features. Changes to stable features follow our deprecation timeline 
  and backward compatibility guarantees.
* **Deprecated**: A feature that is scheduled for removal in a future release.
  It remains fully functional for the time being.
* **Removed**: A feature that is no longer part of the library after its deprecation period has ended.
  Attempting to use a removed feature will result in an error.

Deprecation timeline
--------------------

A feature will typically be maintained for two full minor release cycles after its deprecation. For example, a feature
deprecated in ``v1.8.0`` will remain functional throughout the entire ``v1.8.x`` and ``v1.9.x`` series
and will be removed in ``v1.10.0``. Note that deprecations and removals do not occur in patch releases
(``.1``, ``.2``, etc.), only in major or minor releases (the ``.0`` version).

**Example timeline**

* ``v1.8.0``: A feature is deprecated. Its deprecation is noted in changelog and using it will result in a
  ``DeprecationWarning`` (if applicable). 
* ``v1.8.1``: The deprecated feature remains fully functional.
* ``v1.9.0``: The deprecated feature remains fully functional.
  The release announcement may remind users of the feature's upcoming removal.
* ``v1.9.1``: The deprecated feature remains fully functional.
* ``v1.10.0``: Feature is removed. Using it will result in an error.

While we strive to abide by the above deprecation timeline, there may be circumstances in which a feature is removed
with a briefer or longer deprecation period.

Release support policy
----------------------

Warp follows a rolling release model where only the latest released version is actively maintained:

* **Active Support**: Only the most recent version (e.g., ``v1.10.x``) receives bugfixes, improvements, and updates.
* **Limited Backporting**: By default, when a new version is released, previous versions are no longer actively 
  maintained and fixes are not backported to older release branches. However, in exceptional circumstances where 
  users cannot upgrade to the latest version, we may consider backporting critical fixes on a case-by-case basis.
* **Upgrade Path**: Users who encounter bugs or need fixes should generally upgrade to the latest version. We strive 
  to make upgrades straightforward by following our deprecation timeline and clearly documenting breaking changes.

This policy ensures that development efforts remain focused on improving the latest version while maintaining 
a sustainable maintenance burden for the project.

How deprecations are communicated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We employ multiple channels to ensure users are aware of deprecated and removed features:

**CHANGELOG.md**
    The primary source of truth for all deprecations and removals. Each release's changelog includes
    dedicated **Deprecated** and **Removed** sections. The changelog is available in the GitHub repository
    and at :doc:`changelog`.

**Runtime Warnings**
    When you use a deprecated feature in your code, Warp will emit a ``DeprecationWarning`` to stdout
    the first time the feature is used in your Python session. These warnings include information about
    the deprecated feature and, when applicable, suggest an alternative.

**API Documentation**
    Deprecated features are marked with ``.. deprecated:: X.Y`` directives in the API documentation,
    indicating the version in which deprecation was introduced.

**GitHub Releases**
    Release announcements on https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp/releases. When a deprecated
    feature is approaching its removal date, we typically add reminders in the final
    release series before removal occurs.

Component-specific policies
---------------------------

The following subsections detail support policies for specific components of the Warp ecosystem, 
including the API surface, Python versions, dependencies, CUDA toolkit versions, GPU architectures, 
and operating systems.

API
~~~

Warp's **public API** consists of symbols that are documented in the :doc:`API reference </modules/runtime>`
and accessible without underscore prefixes (e.g., ``warp.function_name()``, ``warp.fem.ClassName``).

The public API is designed to be stable and backward compatible. Changes follow the deprecation
timeline described earlier, with deprecated features maintained for at least two minor release cycles.

**Private APIs**, such as anything under ``warp._src.*`` or any symbols with underscore prefixes 
(e.g., ``warp._private_function()``), can change or be removed without following the deprecation timeline. 
Only the public API is subject to the deprecation policies described in this document.

Python versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Warp aims to support Python versions that are fully released (in "bugfix" or "security" status according
to the `Python version lifecycle <https://devguide.python.org/versions/>`__). 

Support for newly released Python versions is added in the next minor Warp release after the Python
version's stable release (e.g., if Python 3.15.0 is released during the Warp 1.10.x series, support
will be added in Warp 1.11.0).

When a Python version reaches end-of-life, we continue support for at least two additional minor
Warp release cycles before dropping support, allowing users time to migrate.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Required dependencies**

NumPy is the only required runtime dependency for Warp. While we do not follow a strict version 
support policy such as `SPEC 0 <https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/>`__, we generally 
support a wide range of NumPy versions. The minimum supported NumPy version may be updated in 
minor Warp releases following our standard deprecation practices.

**Optional dependencies**

Warp includes optional features and examples that depend on additional packages (e.g., ``usd-core``, 
``matplotlib``, ``warp-lang[extras]``). For these optional dependencies:

* We aim to test against recent versions in our CI/CD pipeline.
* Version support may be adjusted if specific package versions cause CI/CD issues or compatibility 
  problems on certain platforms.
* Users can typically use a range of versions; minimum version requirements are documented in 
  ``pyproject.toml`` when applicable.

**Interoperability libraries**

Warp provides interoperability with machine learning frameworks (PyTorch, JAX, Paddle). For these 
integrations:

* **Target Support**: We aim to support the latest stable release of each framework at the time of 
  a Warp release.
* **Backward Compatibility**: We maintain backward compatibility with older framework versions until 
  doing so becomes a significant maintenance burden. This is particularly relevant for rapidly evolving 
  frameworks like JAX, where API changes may eventually require us to drop support for older versions.
* **Testing**: Our CI/CD pipeline tests against recent versions of these frameworks, though we cannot 
  exhaustively test every version combination.

When interoperability with a specific framework version is broken or deprecated, this will be noted in 
the changelog. Users experiencing compatibility issues should consult the changelog and GitHub issues 
for known problems and workarounds.

CUDA versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Warp supports the two most recent CUDA major versions. Not all features may be available for all CUDA versions.
The documentation will note if a feature has a specific CUDA version requirement.

Pre-built wheels are available for the two supported CUDA major versions, although the specific minor version
used is set at our discretion.

There is currently no policy that controls how we choose the CUDA version that PyPI wheels are built with.
Instead, the version used is selected according to what we believe is the most useful choice for the average user.

NVIDIA driver compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NVIDIA driver requirements are determined by the CUDA Toolkit version used to build Warp, not by Warp itself.
We follow NVIDIA's driver compatibility policies:

* **Minimum Driver Requirements**: Each CUDA Toolkit version has a minimum required driver version. Warp 
  packages built with a specific CUDA Toolkit inherit that minimum driver requirement. See the Driver 
  Requirements bullet in the Runtime requirements section for current minimums.

* **Forward Compatibility**: NVIDIA drivers are forward-compatible with older CUDA Toolkit versions. This 
  means a system with a newer driver (e.g., R580 for CUDA 13.x) can run Warp packages built with older CUDA 
  Toolkit versions (e.g., CUDA 12.8). However, a system with an older driver (e.g., R525 for CUDA 12.x) 
  cannot run Warp packages built with newer CUDA Toolkit versions (e.g., CUDA 13.x) that require a higher 
  minimum driver version.

* **No Backward Compatibility**: CUDA Toolkit versions are not backward-compatible with older drivers. Your 
  driver must meet the minimum requirement for the CUDA Toolkit version used to build your Warp installation. 
  Warp reports both the CUDA Toolkit version used to compile the loaded library and the CUDA Toolkit version 
  associated with your driver during initialization.

For the most up-to-date driver compatibility information, consult the 
`CUDA Compatibility Guide <https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/>`__.

GPU architectures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Warp's GPU architecture support is determined by the CUDA Toolkit version used to build the Warp library. 
The NVRTC (NVIDIA Runtime Compilation) component within the CUDA Toolkit establishes the minimum supported 
compute capability, while PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) forward compatibility allows Warp to target newer 
GPU architectures that were not explicitly compiled as cubin binaries. For more details on the CUDA 
compilation process, see the 
`CUDA Compiler Driver NVCC documentation <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/>`__.

**Architecture support mechanism**

* **Minimum Architecture**: The version of NVRTC in the CUDA Toolkit used to build Warp determines the 
  minimum GPU architecture that can run Warp kernels. See the GPU Compute Capability Requirements table 
  in the Runtime requirements section for current minimums.

* **Forward Compatibility**: Warp leverages PTX virtual architecture compilation to ensure compatibility 
  with newer GPU architectures. When Warp encounters a GPU with a compute capability higher than those 
  explicitly compiled as cubins, the CUDA driver can JIT-compile the PTX intermediate representation to 
  native code for that architecture.

* **Cubin Compilation**: Pre-built Warp packages include cubin binaries for a select set of common GPU 
  architectures to minimize JIT compilation overhead. The specific architectures included are determined 
  by build configuration and may change between minor or major releases, but not between patch releases 
  (except when fixing a bug).

**Changes to architecture support**

GPU architecture support can change in two ways:

1. **Dropping CUDA Toolkit Support**: When Warp drops support for an older CUDA Toolkit major version 
   (typically coinciding with adding support for a new CUDA major version), the minimum supported compute 
   capability may increase to match the new minimum toolkit's requirements. Since CUDA Toolkit release 
   timelines are beyond Warp's control, such changes may occur with limited advance notice, but will 
   always happen in a minor or major Warp release, never in a patch release.

2. **Changing PyPI Wheel Build Configuration**: When we decide to change the CUDA Toolkit version used to 
   build PyPI wheels, this affects the minimum GPU architecture supported by those wheels. Because this 
   change is within our control, we announce it in the release notes of the prior release, giving users 
   advance notice before the new wheels are published.

Users relying on older GPU architectures should monitor Warp's changelog and release announcements for 
information about upcoming architecture support changes.

Operating systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Warp's supported operating systems are primarily determined by the platforms supported by NVIDIA CUDA:

* **Linux**: We support the distributions listed in the 
  `CUDA Installation Guide for Linux <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/>`__. 
  To ensure broad compatibility across Linux distributions, Warp wheels are built against the 
  `manylinux <https://github.com/pypa/manylinux>`__ standard. This approach provides binary 
  compatibility across a wide range of Linux distributions that meet the minimum GLIBC requirements 
  specified in the runtime requirements (GLIBC 2.28+ for ``x86-64``, GLIBC 2.34+ for ``aarch64``).

* **Windows**: We support the Windows versions listed in the 
  `CUDA Installation Guide for Windows <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/>`__.

* **macOS**: Support follows the platform requirements outlined in the Platform compatibility 
  Matrix and Runtime requirements sections above.

Build tools
~~~~~~~~~~~

The build script (``build_lib.py``) and related build infrastructure are developer-facing tools for building 
Warp from source. These scripts have no versioning guarantees:

* **No API Stability**: Command-line options, arguments, and programmatic interfaces may change between 
  releases without advance notice or deprecation warnings.
* **No Backward Compatibility**: Build processes that work with one version may require adjustments for 
  the next version.
* **Self-Documentation**: Use ``python build_lib.py --help`` to see available options for your version.

Users building Warp from source should expect build script interfaces to change between releases and 
use ``--help`` to discover current options.
